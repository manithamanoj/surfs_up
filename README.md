# surfs_up

 ## Introduction
     In this challenge we are going to analyze the temperature trends before opening the surf shop, specifically the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. We are going to use the technologies Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy to analyze the data.

### Analysis

### Determine the Summary Statistics for June 

First, we retrieve the temperatures for the month of June from the database hawaii.sqlite. Then we convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

### Result

### Determine the Summary Statistics for December 


First, we retrieve the temperatures for the month of December from the database hawaii.sqlite. Then we convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

## Summary

The ideal temperature for surfing is between 60 and 80. Here we are analyzing the temperature data for the months during peak summer and peak winter. The average temperature of June is 75 and December is 71. We can see that the temperature variation is less. This means Oahu seems to have less temperature fluctuation over the year. The max and min temperatures of June and December from the result tables says that December data is more spread than June and so are the Standard deviations.

Besides, temperature is just one factor that affects surfing. Before reaching final decision It is also a good idea to consider precipitation analysis, and analyze the other factors such as wind speed which affects surfing.
